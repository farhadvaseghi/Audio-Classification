## Task
The Challenge is to build a Machine Learning model and code to count the number of Capuchinbird calls within a given clip. This can be done in a variety of ways and we would recommend that you do some research into various methods of audio recognition.
## Data
The Data is split into Training and Testing Data. For Training Data we have provided enough clips to get a decent model but you can also find, parse, augment and use additional audio clips to improve your model performance. In order to download the oficial dataset check the link below:

After downloading the dataset create a directory in the root directory with the name data and then put the files into that directory.

## Usage
Check the file AudioClassification.ipynb and go step by step to understand the whole process coprehensively.
